## What is Jellyfish?

A collection of TypeScript + JavaScript tools and libraries for DeFi Blockchain developers to build decentralized 
finance on Bitcoin. Consisting of multiple packages with more to be added in the future, this JS library enables 
developers to create decentralized applications on top of DeFi Blockchain that are modern, easy to use and easy to 
test.

### Monorepo & packages 

As with all modern JavaScript projects, jellyfish follows a monorepo structure with its concerns separated. All packages
maintained in this repo are published with the same version tag and follows the `DeFiCh/ain` releases.

| Package                                      | Description                                                                                                            |
