# DeFiChain Playground API (DeFiCh/playground)

Migration of the entire `DeFiCh/playground` project into `DeFiCh/jellyfish/apps/playground-api`. This project is
different from `DeFiCh/jellyfish/packages/playground`.

## Motivation

> https://github.com/DeFiCh/jellyfish/issues/580

As part of [#580](https://github.com/DeFiCh/jellyfish/issues/580) consolidation efforts. We had multiple projects that
were extensions of the jellyfish project. The separated projects allowed us to move quickly initially but proves to be a
bottleneck when it comes to development.

> https://github.com/DeFiCh/jellyfish/issues/978

We need to maintain this project regardless of the slated deprecation. By migrating this project into
`DeFiCh/jellyfish`, we can maintain it in one place.
