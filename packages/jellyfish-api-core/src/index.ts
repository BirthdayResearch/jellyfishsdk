   *
   * 'number' parse all numeric values as 'Number' and precision will be loss if it exceeds IEEE-754 standard.
   *
   * 'PrecisionPath' path based precision mapping, specifying 'bignumber' will automatically map all Number in that
   * path as 'bignumber'. Otherwise, it will default to number, This applies deeply.
