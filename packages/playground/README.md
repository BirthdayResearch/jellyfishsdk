Playground is a specialized testing blockchain isolated from MainNet for testing DeFi applications. Assets are not real,
they can be minted by anyone. Blocks are configured to generate every 3 seconds, the chain can reset anytime.

A bot-like design centers the playground as a mechanism that allows bootstrapping with an interval cycle. This allows
the developer to mock any behaviors they want with a simulated testing blockchain.
