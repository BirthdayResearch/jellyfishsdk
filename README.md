## Developing & Contributing

Thanks for contributing, here is our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

We use `npm 7` for this project, it's required to set
up [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces).

```shell
npm install
```

### Testing

`jest.config.js` is set up at the root project level as well as at each sub module. You can run jest at root to test all
modules or individually at each sub module. By default, only regtest chain are used for normal testing. If you use
IntelliJ IDEA, you can right click any file to test it individually and have it reported to the IDE.

Docker is required to run the tests as [`@defichain/testcontainers`](./packages/testcontainers) will automatically spin
up `regtest` instances for testing. The number of containers it will spin up concurrently is dependent on your
jest `--maxConcurrency` count. Test are known to be flaky due to the usage of multiple Docker containers for test
concurrency.

Coverage is collected at each pull request to main with `codecov`; more testing üöÄ less üêõ = üòé

```shell
jest
```

### Publishing

`"version": "0.0.0"` is used because publishing will be done automatically
by [GitHub releases](https://github.com/DeFiCh/jellyfish/releases) with connected workflows. On
