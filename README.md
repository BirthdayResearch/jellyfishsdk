<summary><b>Watch this space!</b></summary>

We are consolidating all jellyfish ecosystem projects ocean, whale and playground into this repository.

- For better synergy of DeFiChain open source development across all concerns.
- Consistent versioning for all ecosystem releases with a single source of truth.
- Documentation for the entirety of the jellyfish ecosystem via `jellyfish.defichain.com`. Incorporating sample and
  playground.
- Early regression detection upstream to downstream changes with monolithic repo structure.
