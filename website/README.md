`/apps/website/*` contains the documentation for jellyfish; built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a
modern static website generator.

## Writing documentations

Following the idea of everything in master is production ready; all pull request should be accompanied by a
documentation change. Hence, the master/main branch should be treated as a release as so are the documentations.

## Local Setup

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without
having to restart the server.

```console
npm i
npm run start --workspace=apps/website
```
