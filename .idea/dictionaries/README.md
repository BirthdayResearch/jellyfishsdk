> IntelliJ IDEA helps you make sure that all your source code, including variable names, textual strings, comments, literals, and commit messages, is spelt correctly. For this purpose, IntelliJ IDEA provides a dedicated Typo inspection which is enabled by default.

If you are reading this and wondering why dictionaries files are commited to GitHub.

## Well...

1. Spellcheck everything, code are no expections
2. Adopt the principles of fixing all red/orange/yellow/wavy errors.
3. Treat all text as code, because they are and can introduces bugs. `client.call('generatetoaddress')`
   vs `client.call('generatetoadress')`
4. Lastly, share that same improved developer experience with all IntelliJ IDEA users.
